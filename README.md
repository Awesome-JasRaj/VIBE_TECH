## Visionary Idea Browsing Environment (V.I.B.E)

# There are a lot of people in this world that solve their problems on a regular basis by some form of innovation. They want to create something of their own but lack the resources to do so. They require other like-minded people who can work with them and turn these ideas to reality. But itâ€™s not easy to come up with an idea for which you can totally dedicate yourself into and to find the right set of people to pursue it with.
# But what if we could create a platform that solves this problem. A platform where you can search for new ideas based on what you want to do. A platform where you can share your ideas with others and collaborate with them to take it further.
# By providing users with a relatively easy to use platform, they can come up with new ideas, post ideas and collaborate with like minded people and develop something great.
# Our aim is to create a platform where we will be able to provide the users with the tools to collaborate with each other.

There are 4 aspects to our application:
1) Social Media Platform (Technologies Used: MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
2) Search Engine (Google based search and Local Elastic search based search engine) (Running on a flask server)
3) Recommendation System (ML based TF-IDF Model)
4) Idea Analysis (Classifying comments using sentiment analysis) (Running on a flask server)


# Extra dependecies
1) Please download elastic search: https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch
   Go to the folder downloaded and execute ./bin/elasticsearch
2) Make sure you have node/npm installed in your system as well.

Steps to run the application:

1) Go to Front-End folder and type npm install --save, then start the server using npm start.
2) Go to Back-End folder and type npm install --save, then start the server using npm start.
3) Go to Sentiment-Analysis Model folder and type pip install -r requirements.txt, then start using the server using python3 main.py
4) Go to Search-Engine Model folder and type pip install -r requirements.txt, then start using the server using python3 main.py

Hope this idea inspires others to contribute and make an impact.
